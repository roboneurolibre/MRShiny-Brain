# MRShiny Brain 

The use of human brain data, encompassing structural, functional, and biochemical information, has grown in addressing inquiries related to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. However, the normal variability within these measures has not been systematically reported. In this work, a database comprising these outcome measures in a healthy population (n=51) is presented to potentially serve as a comparative reference with normative values. Standardized procedures ensured consistent collection of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy data, acquired using a 3T scanner with various sequences. Established and custom software tools were employed to analyze outcome measures, providing an overview of the methodology and data acquisition process for potential future utilization.

The online interactive database allows users to filter data based on sex, age, and different brain locations. Additionally, it provides the capability to explore correlations between different outcome measures interactively.
